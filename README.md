This is just a small prank program that I made for fun.

## Installation

Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install necessary packages.

### Compiling

Due to the compiled executable exceeding 100MB, it cannot be included in the repository. After installing necessary packages, install `Pyinstaller` and run `pyinstaller "Totally not a Rickroll.spec"` to create the executable.

## How to Use

Place the executable on a friend's desktop and see what they'll do :)
